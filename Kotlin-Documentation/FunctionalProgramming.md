# Functional Programming

**Kotlin does support functional programming! *(Sort of)* **

Most of the things needed for functional programming are there, but it is missing a few things like Typeclasses and a bunch of functional constructs and abstractions.  Because of this, functional programming can be done in Kotlin but not to the fullest extent.

JetBrains however is evaluating these concerns and is considering implimenting them in the language at a later date.

As a quick-fix to this, there are many libraries out there that seek to bring full on functional programming to Kotlin.
