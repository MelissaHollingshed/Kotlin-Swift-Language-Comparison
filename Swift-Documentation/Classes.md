# Classes
## Defining
Classes are defined with the keyword **class** and standard Swift types use *UpperCamelCase* names
```swift
class SomeClass{

}
```
## Creating new instances
```swift
let SomeClass = Class()
```

## Constructing/initializing

Initializers in swift are written using the **init** keyword
```swift
init() {
    // perform some initialization here
}
```


## Destructing/de-initializing
You write deinitializers with the **deinit** keyword. Deinitializers are only available on class types.

Swift automatically deallocates your instances when they are no longer needed, to free up resources. Typically you donâ€™t need to perform manual cleanup when your instances are deallocated. However, when you are working with your own resources, you might need to perform some additional cleanup yourself.

```swift
deinit {
    // perform the deinitialization
}
```
Deinitializers are called automatically, just before instance deallocation takes place. You are not allowed to call a deinitializer yourself.
